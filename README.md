# Skyhax Discord Token Bruteforcer
The Skyhax Discord Token Bruteforcer is a script that attempts to bruteforce a user's Discord token using their ID. The script encodes the first part of the victim's token with their ID using Base64 and then tries different combinations for the remaining part. Please note that the chances of success are incredibly low, and the speed of your computer will affect the success rate. It is essential to have a stable internet connection and a significant amount of spare data while running this script. If the bruteforcing process is successful, the output will be saved in a file called ``grab.txt`` (which will be created).
