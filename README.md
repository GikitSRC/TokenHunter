# Skyhax Discord Token Bruteforcer
The Skyhax Discord Token Bruteforcer is a program designed to crack a user's Discord token by leveraging their ID. The program employs Base64 encoding to encode the initial portion of the target's token, and then it systematically tests various combinations for the remaining part. It's crucial to note that the likelihood of success is extremely low, and the effectiveness of the process depends on the speed of your computer. To run this script, it is important to have a stable internet connection and a substantial amount of unused data. If the bruteforcing attempt proves fruitful, the resulting information will be saved in a newly created file named ``grab.txt``.
